# Designer Scrape

## Summary
I have been recently been intrigued by the color usage on popular luxury brands. These brands use various color combinations that would be interesting to study. I wrote my dissertation on the brands color usage and their potential brand strategy when it came to color. The code to analyze and understand the brands is here for display and is being continously improved. Feel free to suggest ideas or problems with the code. 

IMPORTANT: Please keep in mind, this code should only be used for ethical purposes and the webscrapping should be done in accordance with the company and region you are located in. Hint: Brands often display the terms in their ROBOT.txt. 

## Installation
Poetry was used as a package manager for this codebase. 
Python 3.7 had the best compatibility with all the pacakges.

## Selected Analysis
For the most consistent results, handbags have been the only thing analyzed. This is because the porportions remain relativly the same and the view is the same within lots of brands. It is planned to enable other forms of object recognition to remove subjects and other items from different types of aperal items.
